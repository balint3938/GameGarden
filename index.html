                        When you start the game, the computer randomly selects a number within a specified range, typically from 1 to 100. Your task is to guess the number by entering your guess in a text box and pressing the submit button. After each guess, you'll receive feedback on whether your guess is too high, too low, or correct.</div>

The objective is simple: choose between paper, rock, or scissors, and try to beat your opponent based on the following rules:

                        Rock beats scissors but loses to paper.
                        Paper beats rock but loses to scissors.
                        Scissors beats paper but loses to rock.
                        To play, simply select one of the three options—paper, rock, or scissors. Once you make your choice, the computer also selects one. The results are then compared, and you'll find out if you won, lost, or tied.
                        
                        This game is a fun and quick way to test your luck and strategy. Challenge yourself to see how many rounds you can win in a row, or play with friends to see who comes out on top. Ready to play? Choose your move and let the game begin!</div>

                        The game board consists of a set number of cards laid face down. To play, you flip over two cards at a time, revealing their images or symbols. If the two cards match, they remain face up, indicating that you've found a pair. If they don't match, the cards are turned back face down, and you try again.
                        
                        The Memory Card Game is a great way to improve your memory and pattern recognition, and it's fun for all ages.

            <div class="overlay">Welcome to the Sliding Puzzle Game! This classic puzzle game challenges your problem-solving skills as you work to reassemble a scrambled image or a numbered grid. The goal is to rearrange the tiles into the correct order by sliding them into the empty space.

                In this game, you'll start with a board containing a series of tiles that are shuffled into a random arrangement. One tile space is left empty, allowing you to slide adjacent tiles into it. Your task is to strategically slide the tiles to restore the original image or sequential order of numbers.
                
                To play, simply click or drag the tiles adjacent to the empty space. The fewer moves you make, the better! Aim to arrange the tiles in ascending order.
                
                The sliding puzzle game is a great way to sharpen your spatial reasoning and problem-solving skills. Enjoy the challenge and see how quickly you can solve the puzzle! Good luck, and have fun!</div>
